# Sjtu m3dv final project - 517021910077 吴禹宣
## Files and folders
In the folder called 'sjtu-m3dv-medical-3d-voxel-classification\test', there are all the test candidates downloaded from kaggle.
'net.pth' and 'optimizer' includes the data in the trained model.
'test.py' is the final test python file that uses the trained model on the test dataset. 
## How to run
Run 'test.py' and there will be a file named 'submission.csv' which is the final result.
## P.S.
Because of my stupidity I think the last .csv file I submitted on Kaggle was a wrong .csv file that didn't match the result from the model in this repository. I'm terribly sorry for that.
